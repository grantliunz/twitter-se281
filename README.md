# Twitter follow relations 

## Learning Outcomes

The purpose of this assignment is to target the following learning outcomes:

- You will be able to represent Graphs using object-oriented concepts.
- You will be able to implement common data structures like LinkedLists, Stacks and Queues and develop them using Java Generics.
- You will be able to implement search operations on Graphs using algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) and understand the difference between BFS and DFS.
- You will be able to understand and verify key mathematical properties of Graphs such as reflexive, symmetric, transitive.
- You will be able to compute the equivalence class of Twitter users from the provided graph, when it represents an equivalence relation.
- You will be able to improve your understanding of unit testing with `JUnit`.
- You will be able to practice inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
- You will be able to read and understand some pre-developed code and extend it, which is a key learning outcome for software developers.
